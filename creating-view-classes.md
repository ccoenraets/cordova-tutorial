title: Module 9&#58; Creating Views
---
It's time to provide the application with some structure. If we keep adding all the core functions of the application to the immediate function that bootstraps the app, it will very quickly grow out of control. In this section we create a HomeView object that encapsulates the logic to create and render the Home view.

## Step 1: Create the Home View


1. Create a file named HomeView.js in the js directory, and define a HomeView constructor implemented as follows:

    ```
    var HomeView = function (service) {
    
    }
    ```


  >The constructor function takes the employee data service as an argument

2. HomeView uses a nested view to display the list of employees. Defining the list of employees as a separate view makes it reusable in other contexts. We will define EmployeeListView in Step 2 below. For now, define a local variable to keep track of the nested view.

    ```
    var HomeView = function (service) {
    
        var employeeListView;
    
    }
    ```

2. Define an initialize() function inside the HomeView constructor.
    - Define a div wrapper for the view. The div wrapper is used to attach the view-related events.
    - Instantiate the nested view (you'll define EmployeeListView in step 2).
    - Finally, invoke the initialize() function inside the HomeView constructor function.

    ```
    var HomeView = function (service) {
    
        var employeeListView;
        
        this.initialize = function () {
            // Define a div wrapper for the view (used to attach events)
            this.$el = $('<div/>');
            this.$el.on('keyup', '.search-key', this.findByName);
            employeeListView = new EmployeeListView();
            this.render();
        };
        
        this.initialize();
    
    }
    ```

3. Move the renderHomeView() function from app.js to the HomeView class. To keep the view reusable, attach the HTML to the div wrapper (this.el) instead of the document body. Because the function is now encapsulated in HomeView, you can also rename it from renderHomeView() to just render().

    ```
    this.render = function() {
        this.$el.html(this.template());
        $('.content', this.$el).html(employeeListView.$el);
        return this;
    };
    ```

4. Move the findByName() function from app.js to HomeView and adjust it to work with the nested view.

    ```
    this.findByName = function() {
        service.findByName($('.search-key').val()).done(function(employees) {
            employeeListView.setEmployees(employees);
        });
    };
    ```


## Step 2: Create the EmployeeList View

1. Create a file named EmployeeListView.js in the js directory

2. Implement EmployeeListView as follows:

    ```
    var EmployeeListView = function () {
    
        var employees;
        
        this.initialize = function() {
            this.$el = $('<div/>');
            this.render();
        };
        
        this.setEmployees = function(list) {
            employees = list;
            this.render();
        }
        
        this.render = function() {
            this.$el.html(this.template(employees));
            return this;
        };
        
        this.initialize();
    
    }
    ```

## Step 3: Using the Home View

1. In index.html, add script tags to include EmployeeListView.js and HomeView.js (just **before** the script tag for app.js):

    ```
    <script src="js/EmployeeListView.js"></script>
    <script src="js/HomeView.js"></script>
    ```


1. In app.js, remove the renderHomeView() function.

1. Remove the findByName() function.

1. Modify the templates initialization. Instead of declaring them as local variables, add them to the prototype of their respective classes:

    ```
    HomeView.prototype.template = Handlebars.compile($("#home-tpl").html());
    EmployeeListView.prototype.template = 
                Handlebars.compile($("#employee-list-tpl").html());
    
    ```

1. Modify the service  initialization logic to display the Home View when the service  has been successfully initialized. Pass the service  as an argument to the Home View constructor.

    ```
    service.initialize().done(function () {
        $('body').html(new HomeView(service).render().$el);
    });
    ```

1. Test the application


<div class="row" style="margin-top:40px;">
<div class="col-sm-12">
<a href="handlebars-templates.html" class="btn btn-default"><i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-left"></i> 
Previous</a>
<a href="routing.html" class="btn btn-default pull-right">Next <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-right"></i></a>
</div>
</div>
